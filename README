Description:
------------

MyStats is a statistic module much like Stats.mod. The big difference
between them both are that MyStats uses a MySQL server to store
and keep track of data.

MyStats no longer supports use of the internal userfile of the
eggdrop. Versions prior to 1.0pre1 are no longer supported.


Quick installation:
-------------------

Untar mystats.mod-1.79.tar.gz in .../src/mod, then compile the eggdrop
as usual. When compiled and installed run .../src/mod/mystats.mod/tools/setup.sh

Start your eggdrop and enjoy.


Installation from tarball:
--------------------------

Assuming you have a working MySQL server with a user and database all
you need to do is follow a few simple steps.

Un tar the eggdrop source at location of your choice, I will assume that
the source is in ~/eggdrop1.6.15/.

Move the mystats.mod-1.79.tar.gz to ~/eggdrop-1.8.4/src/mod and untar.
# mv mystats.mod-1.79.tar.gz ~/eggdrop-1.8.4/src/mod
# cd ~/eggdrop-1.8.4/src/mod
# tar -zxvf mystats.mod-1.79.tar.gz

Go back to the root of the source-tree, configure, make and install. The
make will use mysql_config to grab correct compilation flags and library
paths. Please, verify that the output from mysql_config is correct.
# cd ~/eggdrop-1.8.4/
# ./configure
# make config
# make && make install DEST=~/eggdrop

When the eggdrop is installed you need to setup the MySQL tables and your
eggdrop configuration file. All this is done by a script called setup.sh.
# ~/eggdrop-1.8.4/src/mod/mystats.mod/tools/setup.sh

All done, hopefully your eggdrop will load without any errors :) If you
want to make your MyStats module more personal, please take a look at the
'Further configuration' section below.


Upgrading
---------

You need to run update-from1.XX.sh found in .../mystats.mod/tools.

 o From v1.0, v1.12, v1.24 or v1.36 run update-from1.36.sh
 o From v1.42, v1.50 or v1.58 run update-from1.58.sh
 o From v1.62 no update required.

Versions prior to the 1.X series are no longer supported.


Further configuration
---------------------

MyStats has a word-counter, to enable it set swords to 1, like so:
# set swords 1

You can use the 'scats' variable to specify which categories are to be shown
by the !stats command. Ie, put this in your eggdrop.conf:
# set scats "words kicks kicked actions online wpm"
All valid categories are as follow: lines words joins kicks kicked questions
topics actions online wpm . Please only use lowercase letters.

You can change the category names as you wish. Just edit the language file
where appropriate. The counters will still count the same thing, but if
you want you can get the bot display 'words' as 'w0rdZ'.


Partyline commands:
-------------------

+suser <handle> [host]
    Add a user with or without host.
-suser <handle>
    Delete a user.
+sbot <handle> [host]
    Add a bot with or without host. Bots are exempted from the general stats.
-sbot <handle>
    Delete a bot.
+shost <handle> <host>
    Add host to a user.
-shost <host>
    Remove host.
smatch <handle>
    List users. Use % as wildcard.
+schan <channel>
    Start monitor channel (The bot needs to be on that channel).
-schan <channel>
    Stop monitor channel.
spurge <channel>
    Delete all stats in an inactive channel.
schannel <channel>
    Shows list of users with their handle.


Public chat commands:
---------------------

!top10 [order by]
    Shows top ten users, ordered by words as default.
!stats [nick]
    Shows your or nick's stats.
!place [nick] [order by]
    Shows nick's place, ordered by words as default.
!ranking [nick]
    Shows nicks' place in categories (using scats = showing same categories
    as !stats).
!words [nick]
    Shows most used words (only available if 'swords' is set)
!uttered [word]
    Shows how many times users have said a word.

If you want to specify a handle instead of a nick (ie if a user is offline) you
can do so by adding a dash, '-': !stats -user_name
